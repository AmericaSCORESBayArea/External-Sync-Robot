# Project Purpose
The Sync-Robot seeks to eliminate double entry work from humans and provide a secure, reliable method of publish-subscribe reporting to third parties.
It utilizes the Mulesoft API's to find, create, and update records of Students, Teams, Enrollments, and Attendancem depending on the contract needs with the third-party.
# Why not API-API?
The reality of many school district systems is they provide only Web-API access, which follows the logical flow provided for human user manipulation. This system overcomes that barrier by behaving like a human user, much like a Web automation testing system does.
